## Portfolio Website - Interactive Circle sandbox.

# Reasoning:
This Portfolio website project is an interactive sandbox with objects that interact with each other via natural physics. <br />
The intent of this project is to provide a more interesting and engaging experience for users who may be looking through my projects <br />
By engaging the user through interaction, the user will engage better with the subject matter. <br />
Further development of this portfolio will include implementation of a design that incorporates the sandbox window naturally into viewing of projects, <br />
as well as implementation of a sleek and flowy design that attempts to synthesise different Web Development processes <br />
